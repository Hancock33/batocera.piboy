# Config.in.legacy - support for backward compatibility
#
# When an existing Config.in symbol is removed, it should be added again in this
# file, and take appropriate action to approximate backward compatibility. If
# there is an equivalent (set of) new symbols, these can just be select'ed by
# the old symbol. This makes sure that running 'make oldconfig' will make things
# "just work" when upgrading to a new buildroot version. If the change is too
# fundamental and cannot be fixed by a simple select, then the old symbol should
# select BR2_LEGACY.  If that symbol is set, the build will issue an error.
#
# When adding legacy symbols to this file, add them to the front. The oldest
# symbols will be removed again after about two years.
#
# The symbol should be copied as-is from the place where it was previously
# defined, but the help text should be removed or replaced with something that
# explains how to fix it.

config BR2_LEGACY

	help
	  This option is selected automatically when your old .config uses an
	  option that no longer exists in current buildroot. In that case, the
	  build will fail. Look for config options which are selected in the
	  menu below: they no longer exist and should be replaced by something
	  else.
