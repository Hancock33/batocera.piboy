    <h2><a name="about" id="about"></a>About Buildroot</h2>

    <p>Buildroot is a set of Makefiles and patches that allows to easily
    generate both a cross-compilation toolchain and a root filesystem for your
    target. The cross-compilation toolchain uses uClibc (<a href=
    "http://www.uclibc.org/">http://www.uclibc.org/</a>), a tiny C standard
    library.</p>

    <p>Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
    Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
    processors everyone is used to have on his PC. It can be PowerPC
    processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.</p>

    <p>A compilation toolchain is the set of tools that allows to
    compile code for your system. It consists of a compiler (in our
    case, <code>gcc</code>), binary utils like assembler and linker
    (in our case, <code>binutils</code>) and a C standard library (for
    example <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU
    Libc</a>, <a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> or <a
    href="http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/">dietlibc</a>). The system
    installed on your development station certainly already has a
    compilation toolchain that you can use to compile application that
    runs on your system. If you're using a PC, your compilation
    toolchain runs on an x86 processor and generates code for a x86
    processor. Under most Linux systems, the compilation toolchain
    uses the GNU libc as C standard library.  This compilation
    toolchain is called the "host compilation toolchain", and more
    generally, the machine on which it is running, and on which you're
    working is called the "host system". The compilation toolchain is
    provided by your distribution, and Buildroot has nothing to do
    with it.</p>

    <p>As said above, the compilation toolchain that comes with your system
    runs and generates code for the processor of your host system. As your
    embedded system has a different processor, you need a cross-compilation
    toolchain: it's a compilation toolchain that runs on your host system but
    that generates code for your target system (and target processor). For
    example, if your host system uses x86 and your target system uses ARM, the
    regular compilation toolchain of your host runs on x86 and generates code
    for x86, while the cross-compilation toolchain runs on x86 and generates
    code for ARM.</p>

    <p>Even if your embedded system uses a x86 processor, you might interested
    in Buildroot, for two reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The compilation toolchain of your host certainly uses the GNU Libc
      which is a complete but huge C standard library. Instead of using GNU
      Libc on your target system, you can use uClibc which is a tiny C standard
      library. If you want to use this C library, then you need a compilation
      toolchain to generate binaries linked with it. Buildroot can do it for
      you.</li>

      <li>Buildroot automates the building of a root filesystem with all needed
      tools like busybox. It makes it much easier than doing it by hand.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You might wonder why such a tool is needed when you can compile
    <code>gcc</code>, <code>binutils</code>, uClibc and all the tools by hand.
    Of course, doing so is possible. But dealing with all configure options,
    with all problems of every <code>gcc</code> or <code>binutils</code>
    version it very time-consuming and uninteresting. Buildroot automates this
    process through the use of Makefiles, and has a collection of patches for
    each <code>gcc</code> and <code>binutils</code> version to make them work
    on most architectures.</p>

    <h2><a name="download" id="download"></a>Obtaining Buildroot</h2>

    <p>Buildroot is available as daily CVS snapshots or directly using
    CVS.</p>

    <p>The latest snapshot is always available at <a
    href="http://uclibc.org/downloads/snapshots/buildroot-snapshot.tar.bz2">http://uclibc.org/downloads/snapshots/buildroot-snapshot.tar.bz2</a>,
    and previous snapshots are also available at <a
    href="http://uclibc.org/downloads/snapshots/">http://uclibc.org/downloads/snapshots/</a>.</p>

    <p>To download Buildroot using CVS, you can simply follow
    the rules described on the "Accessing CVS"-page (<a href=
    "http://www.uclibc.org/cvs_anon.html">http://www.uclibc.org/cvs_anon.html</a>)
    of the uClibc website (<a href=
    "http://www.uclibc.org">http://www.uclibc.org</a>), and download the
    <code>buildroot</code> CVS module. For the impatient, here's a quick
    recipe:</p>

 <pre>
 $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@uclibc.org:/var/cvs login
 $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@uclibc.org:/var/cvs co buildroot
</pre>

    <h2><a name="using" id="using"></a>Using Buildroot</h2>

    <p>Buildroot has a nice configuration tool similar to the one you can find
    in the Linux Kernel (<a href=
    "http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</a>) or in Busybox
    (<a href="http://www.busybox.org/">http://www.busybox.org/</a>). Note that
    you can run everything as a normal user. There is no need to be root to
    configure and use Buildroot. The first step is to run the configuration
    assistant:</p>

<pre>
 $ make menuconfig
</pre>

    <p>For each entry of the configuration tool, you can find associated help
    that describes the purpose of the entry.</p>

    <p>Once everything is configured, the configuration tool has generated a
    <code>.config</code> file that contains the description of your
    configuration. It will be used by the Makefiles to do what's needed.</p>

    <p>Let's go:</p>

<pre>
 $ make
</pre>

    <p>This command will download, configure and compile all the selected
    tools, and finally generate a target filesystem. The target filesystem will
    be named <code>root_fs_ARCH.EXT</code> where <code>ARCH</code> is your
    architecture and <code>EXT</code> depends on the type of target filesystem
    selected in the <code>Target options</code> section of the configuration
    tool.</p>

    <h2><a name="custom_targetfs" id="custom_targetfs"></a>Customizing the
    target filesystem</h2>

    <p>There are two ways to customize the resulting target filesystem:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Customize the target filesystem directly, and rebuild the image. The
      target filesystem is available under <code>build_ARCH/root/</code> where
      <code>ARCH</code> is the chosen target architecture. You can simply make
      your changes here, and run make afterwards, which will rebuild the target
      filesystem image. This method allows to do everything on the target
      filesystem, but if you decide to completely rebuild your toolchain and
      tools, these changes will be lost.</li>

      <li>Customize the target filesystem skeleton, available under
      <code>target/default/target_skeleton/</code>. You can customize
      configuration files or other stuff here. However, the full file hierarchy
      is not yet present, because it's created during the compilation process.
      So you can't do everything on this target filesystem skeleton, but
      changes to it remains even you completely rebuild the cross-compilation
      toolchain and the tools.<br />
      You can also customize the <code>target/default/device_table.txt</code>
      file which is used by the tools that generate the target filesystem image
      to properly set permissions and create device nodes. The
      <code>target/default/skel.tar.gz</code> file contains the main
      directories of a root filesystem and there is no obvious reason for which
      it should be changed. These main directories are in an tarball inside of
      inside the skeleton because it contains symlinks that would be broken
      otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="custom_busybox" id="custom_busybox"></a>Customizing the
    Busybox configuration</h2>

    <p>Busybox is very configurable, and you may want to customize it. You can
    follow these simple steps to do it. It's not an optimal way, but it's
    simple and it works.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Make a first compilation of buildroot with busybox without trying to
      customize it.</li>

      <li>Go into <code>build_ARCH/busybox/</code> and run <code>make
      menuconfig</code>. The nice configuration tool appears and you can
      customize everything.</li>

      <li>Copy the <code>.config</code> file to
      <code>package/busybox/busybox.config</code> so that your customized
      configuration will remains even if you remove the cross-compilation
      toolchain.</li>

      <li>Run the compilation of buildroot again.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Otherwise, you can simply change the
    <code>package/busybox/busybox.config</code> file if you know the options
    you want to change without using the configuration tool.</p>

    <h2><a name="custom_uclibc" id="custom_uclibc"></a>Customizing the uClibc
    configuration</h2>

    <p>Just like <a href="#custom_busybox">BusyBox</a>, <a
    href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> offers a lot of
    configuration options. They allow to select various
    functionalities, depending on your needs and limitations.</p>

    <p>The easiest way to modify the configuration of uClibc is to
    follow these steps :</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Make a first compilation of buildroot without trying to
      customize uClibc.</li>

      <li>Go into the directory
      <code>toolchain_build_ARCH/uClibc/</code> and run <code>make
      menuconfig</code>. The nice configuration assistant, similar to
      the one used in the Linux Kernel or in Buildroot appears. Make
      your configuration as appropriate.</li>

      <li>Copy the <code>.config</code> file to
      <code>toolchain/uClibc/uClibc.config</code> or
      <code>toolchain/uClibc/uClibc.config-locale</code>. The former
      is used if you haven't selected locale support in Buildroot
      configuration, and the latter is used if you have selected
      locale support.</li>

      <li>Run the compilation of Buildroot again</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Otherwise, you can simply change
    <code>toolchain/uClibc/uClibc.config</code> or
    <code>toolchain/uClibc/uClibc.config-locale</code> without running
    the configuration assistant.</p>

    <h2><a name="buildroot_innards" id="buildroot_innards"></a>How Buildroot
    works</h2>

    <p>As said above, Buildroot is basically a set of Makefiles that download,
    configure and compiles software with the correct options. It also includes
    some patches for various software, mainly the ones involved in the
    cross-compilation tool chain (<code>gcc</code>, <code>binutils</code> and
    uClibc).</p>

    <p>There is basically one Makefile per software, and they are named with
    the <code>.mk</code> extension. Makefiles are split into three
    sections:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>package</b> (in the <code>package/</code> directory) contains the
      Makefiles and associated files for all user-space tools that Buildroot
      can compile and add to the target root filesystem. There is one
      sub-directory per tool.</li>

      <li><b>toolchain</b> (in the <code>toolchain/</code> directory) contains
      the Makefiles and associated files for all software related to the
      cross-compilation toolchain : <code>binutils</code>, <code>ccache</code>,
      <code>gcc</code>, <code>gdb</code>, <code>kernel-headers</code> and
      <code>uClibc</code>.</li>

      <li><b>target</b> (in the <code>target</code> directory) contains the
      Makefiles and associated files for software related to the generation of
      the target root filesystem image. Four types of filesystems are supported
      : ext2, jffs2, cramfs and squashfs. For each of them, there's a
      sub-directory with the required files. There is also a
      <code>default/</code> directory that contains the target filesystem
      skeleton.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each directory contains at least 2 files :</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>something.mk</code> is the Makefile that downloads, configures,
      compiles and installs the software <code>something</code>.</li>

      <li><code>Config.in</code> is a part of the configuration tool
      description file. It describes the option related to the current
      software.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The main Makefile do the job through the following steps (once the
    configuration is done):</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create the download directory (<code>dl/</code> by default). This is
      where the tarballs will be downloaded. It is interesting to know that the
      tarballs are in this directory because it may be useful to save them
      somewhere to avoid further downloads.</li>

      <li>Create the build directory (<code>build_ARCH/</code> by default,
      where <code>ARCH</code> is your architecture). This is where all
      user-space tools while be compiled.</li>

      <li>Create the toolchain build directory
      (<code>toolchain_build_ARCH/</code> by default, where <code>ARCH</code>
      is your architecture). This is where the cross compilation toolchain will
      be compiled.</li>

      <li>Setup the staging directory (<code>build_ARCH/staging_dir/</code> by
      default). This is where the cross-compilation toolchain will be
      installed. If you want to use the same cross-compilation toolchain for
      other purposes, such as compiling third-party applications, you can add
      <code>build_ARCH/staging_dir/bin</code> to your PATH, and then use
      <code>arch-linux-gcc</code> to compile your application. In order to
      setup this staging directory, it first removes it, and then it creates
      various subdirectories and symlinks inside it.</li>

      <li>Create the target directory (<code>build_ARCH/root/</code> by
      default) and the target filesystem skeleton. This directory will contain
      the final root filesystem. To setup it up, it first deletes it, then it
      uncompress the <code>target/default/skel.tar.gz</code> file to create the
      main subdirectories and symlinks, copies the skeleton available in
      <code>target/default/target_skeleton</code> and then removes useless
      <code>CVS/</code> directories.</li>

      <li>Add the <code>TARGETS</code> dependency. This should generally check
      if the configuration option for this package is enabled, and if so then
      "subscribe" this package to be compiled by adding it to the TARGETS
      global variable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="using_toolchain" id="using_toolchain"></a>Using the
    uClibc toolchain</h2>

    <p>You may want to compile your own programs or other software
    that are not packaged in Buildroot. In order to do this, you can
    use the toolchain that was generated by Buildroot.</p>

    <p>The toolchain generated by Buildroot by default is located in
    <code>build_ARCH/staging_dir/</code>. The simplest way to use it
    is to add <code>build_ARCH/staging_dir/bin/</code> to your PATH
    environnement variable, and then to use
    <code>arch-linux-gcc</code>, <code>arch-linux-objdump</code>,
    <code>arch-linux-ld</code>, etc.</p>

    <p>For example, you may add the following to your
    <code>.bashrc</code> (considering you're building for the MIPS
    architecture and that Buildroot is located in
    <code>~/buildroot/</code>) :</p>

<pre>
export PATH=$PATH:~/buildroot/build_mips/bin/
</pre>

    <p>Then you can simply do :</p>

<pre>
mips-linux-gcc -o foo foo.c
</pre>

    <p><b>Important</b> : do not try to move the toolchain to an other
    directory, it won't work. There are some hard-coded paths in the
    <i>gcc</i> configuration. If the default toolchain directory
    doesn't suit your needs, please refer to the <a
    href="#toolchain_standalone">Using the uClibc toolchain outside of
    buildroot</a> section.</p>

    <h2><a name="toolchain_standalone" id="toolchain_standalone"></a>Using the
    uClibc toolchain outside of buildroot</h2>

    <p>By default, the cross-compilation toolchain is generated inside
    <code>build_ARCH/staging_dir/</code>. But sometimes, it may be useful to
    install it somewhere else, so that it can be used to compile other programs
    or by other users. Moving the <code>build_ARCH/staging_dir/</code>
    directory elsewhere is <b>not possible</b>, because they are some hardcoded
    paths in the toolchain configuration.</p>

    <p>If you want to use the generated toolchain for other purposes,
    you can configure Buildroot to generate it elsewhere using the
    option of the configuration tool : <code>Build options ->
    Toolchain and header file location</code>, which defaults to
    <code>$(BUILD_DIR)/staging_dir/</code>.</p>

    <h2><a name="downloaded_packages"
    id="downloaded_packages"></a>Location of downloaded packages</h2>

    <p>It might be useful to know that the various tarballs that are
    downloaded by the <i>Makefiles</i> are all stored in the
    <code>DL_DIR</code> which by default is the <code>dl</code>
    directory. It's useful for example if you want to keep a complete
    version of Buildroot which is know to be working with the
    associated tarballs. This will allow you to regenerate the
    toolchain and the target filesystem with exactly the same
    versions.</p>

    <h2><a name="add_software" id="add_software"></a>Extending Buildroot with
    more software</h2>

    <p>This section will only consider the case in which you want to
    add user-space software.</p>

    <h3>Package directory</h3>

    <p>First of all, create a directory under the <code>package</code>
    directory for your software, for example <code>foo</code>.</p>

    <h3><code>Config.in</code> file</h3>

    <p>Then, create a file named <code>Config.in</code>. This file
    will contain the portion of options description related to our
    <code>foo</code> software that will be used and displayed in the
    configuration tool. It should basically contain :</p>

<pre>
config BR2_PACKAGE_FOO
        bool "foo"
        default n
        help
	     This is a comment that explains what foo is.
</pre>

    <p>Of course, you can add other options to configure particular
    things in your software.</p>

   <h3>The real <i>Makefile</i></h3>

   <p>Finally, here's the hardest part. Create a file named
   <code>foo.mk</code>. It will contain the <i>Makefile</i> rules that
   are in charge of downloading, configuring, compiling and installing
   the software. Below is an example that we will comment
   afterwards.</p>

<pre>

    <p>First of all, this <i>Makefile</i> example works for a single
    binary software. For other software such as libraries or more
    complex stuff with multiple binaries, it should be adapted. Look at
    the other <code>*.mk</code> files in the <code>package</code>
    directory.</p>

    <p>At lines 6-11, a couple of useful variables are defined :</p>

    <ul>

     <li><code>FOO_VERSION</code> : The version of <i>foo</i> that
     should be downloaded.</li>

     <li><code>FOO_SOURCE</code> : The name of the tarball of
     <i>foo</i> on the download website of FTP site. As you can see
     <code>FOO_VERSION</code> is used.</li>

     <li><code>FOO_SITE</code> : The HTTP or FTP site from which
     <i>foo</i> archive is downloaded. It must include the complete
     path to the directory where <code>FOO_SOURCE</code> can be
     found.</li>

     <li><code>FOO_DIR</code> : The directory into which the software
     will be configured and compiled. Basically, it's a subdirectory
     of <code>BUILD_DIR</code> which is created upon decompression of
     the tarball.</li>

     <li><code>FOO_BINARY</code> : Software binary name. As said
     previously, this is an example for a single binary software.</li>

     <li><code>FOO_TARGET_BINARY</code> : The full path of the binary
     inside the target filesystem.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Lines 13-14 defines a target that downloads the tarball from
    the remote site to the download directory
    (<code>DL_DIR</code>).</p>

    <p>Lines 16-18 defines a target and associated rules that
    uncompress the downloaded tarball. As you can see, this target
    depends on the tarball file, so that the previous target (line
    13-14) is called before executing the rules of the current
    target. Uncompressing is followed by <i>touching</i> a hidden file
    to mark the software has having been uncompressed. This trick is
    used everywhere in Buildroot <i>Makefile</i> to split steps
    (download, uncompress, configure, compile, install) while still
    having correct dependencies.</p>

    <p>Lines 20-31 defines a target and associated rules that
    configures the software. It depends on the previous target (the
    hidden <code>.source</code> file) so that we are sure the software has
    been uncompressed. In order to configure it, it basically runs the
    well-known <code>./configure</code>script. As we may be doing
    cross-compilation, <code>target</code>, <code>host</code> and
    <code>build</code> arguments are given. The prefix is also set to
    <code>/usr</code>, not because the software will be installed in
    <code>/usr</code> on your host system, but in the target
    filesystem. Finally it creates a <code>.configured</code> file to
    mark the software as configured.</p>

    <p>Lines 33-34 defines a target and a rule that compiles the
    software. This target will create the binary file in the
    compilation directory, and depends on the software being already
    configured (hence the reference to the <code>.configured</code>
    file). It basically runs <code>make</code> inside the source
    directory.</p>

    <p>Lines 36-38 defines a target and associated rules that install
    the software inside the target filesystem. It depends on the
    binary file in the source directory, to make sure the software has
    been compiled. It uses the <code>install</code> target of the
    software <code>Makefile</code> by passing a <code>prefix</code>
    argument, so that the <code>Makefile</code> doesn't try to install
    the software inside host <code>/usr</code> but inside target
    <code>/usr</code>. After the installation, the
    <code>/usr/man</code> directory inside the target filesystem is
    removed to save space.</p>

    <p>Line 40 defines the main target of the software, the one
    that will be eventually be used by the top level
    <code>Makefile</code> to download, compile, and then install
    this package. This target should first of all depends on all
    needed dependecies of the software (in our example,
    <i>uclibc</i> and <i>ncurses</i>), and also depend on the
    final binary. This last dependency will call all previous
    dependencies in the correct order. </p>

    <p>Line 42 defines a simple target that only downloads the code
    source. This is not used during normal operation of Buildroot, but
    might be useful.</p>

    <p>Lignes 44-46 define a simple target to clean the software build
    by calling the <i>Makefiles</i> with the appropriate option.</p>

    <p>Lines 48-49 define a simple target to completely remove the
    directory in which the software was uncompressed, configured and
    compiled.</p>

    <p>Lines 51-58 adds the target <code>foo</code> to the list
    of targets to be compiled by Buildroot by first checking if
    the configuration option for this package has been enabled
    using the configuration tool, and if so then "subscribes"
    this package to be compiled by adding it to the TARGETS
    global variable.  The name added to the TARGETS global
    variable is the name of this package's target, as defined on
    line 40, which is used by Buildroot to download, compile, and
    then install this package.</p>


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>As you can see, adding a software to buildroot is simply a
    matter of writing a <i>Makefile</i> using an already existing
    example and to modify it according to the compilation process of
    the software.</p>

    <p>If you package software that might be useful for other persons,
    don't forget to send a patch to Buildroot developers !</p>
