    <p>We have a <a href="images/logo.png">logo</a>! We have so far
    been using the <a href="http://busybox.net">Busybox</a> logo on
    the website, as the website was a copy of the <a
    href="http://busybox.net">Busybox</a> one - But not anymore, we
    now have a shiny new logo of our own.</p>

  <li><b>16 July 2006 -- Buildroot mailing list</b>
    <p>Buildroot now has its own <a href=lists.html>mailing list</a>.</p>

  <li><b>21 February 2005 -- Buildroot webpage added</b><p>

    Buildroot is a set of Makefiles and patches that makes it easy generate a
    cross-compilation toolchain and root filesystem for your target Linux
    system using the <a href= "http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc C library</a>.
    Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with small or embedded
    systems.  Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular
    x86 processors everyone is used to using on their PC. It can be PowerPC
    processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.  And to be extra safe,
    you do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.

    <p>

    And as of today buildroot even has its own webpage, making it a first class
    citizen of uclibc.org and busybox.net, and more importantly, make it easy
    to find and point to buildroot.

    <p>

    If you find a bug in buildroot, or wish to submit a patch to fix a problem
    or add a shiny new feature, please use the <a
    href="http://bugs.uclibc.org/">Bug and Patch Tracking System</a> to post
    the details, to make certain your work is not lost.
