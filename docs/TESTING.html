<h2>Testing Buildroot for an Architecture</h2>

<p>
<h4>scripts/mkpkg script</h4>
If you want to test the build of a single package you can use the mkpkg script.
</p>
<p>
<li>$ scripts/mkpkg PACKAGE</li> 
</p>
<p>
Will make the board, and save the result in a log file.
The log file resides in
<li>$ log/OK/PACKAGE.log.OK</li> 
</p>
<p>
if the build succeeds and in
<li>$ log/OK/PACKAGE.log.FAIL</li>
</p>
<p>
if it cannot complete.
</p>

<p>
By creating an alias
<li>alias mk=scripts/mkpkg</li>
</p>
<p>
it is enough to type
<li>$ mk PACKAGE</li> 
</p>
<p>
mkpkg will only print out the <h4>{PACKAGE}......OK</h4> or <h4>{PACKAGE}......FAIL</h4>
depending on success or failure making it easy to get an overview
of the status of this specific architecture.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended to build a simple board before running the test
to get some basic things done.
</p>
<p>
<h4>scripts/buildall.sh script</h4>
</p>
<p>
By running this script you will run scripts/mkpkg on
a lot of the packages available in Buildroot.
</p>
<p>
You need to run the script while in the TOP directory.
I.E: Where you typically run make.
</p>
<p>
There are a few lacking, for no very good reason,
but these can be easily added.
</p>
<p>
Note that some packages will not build properly
if you do not enable them using makeconfig.
</p>
<p>
Examples are:
<li>freetype</li>
<li>socat</li>
</p>
