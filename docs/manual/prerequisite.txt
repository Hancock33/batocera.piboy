System requirements
-------------------

Buildroot is design to run on Linux system.

Buildroot needs some software to be already installed on the host
system; hereafter the lists of the mandatory and optional packages
(package names may vary between distributions).

Take care of _installing both runtime and development data_, especially
for the libraries that may be packaged in 2 distinct packages.
