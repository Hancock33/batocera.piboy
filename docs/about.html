Buildroot is a set of Makefiles and patches that makes it easy to generate a
cross-compilation toolchain and root filesystem for your target Linux
system using the <a href= "http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc C library</a>.
Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with small or embedded
systems.  Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular
x86 processors everyone is used to using on their PC. It can be PowerPC
processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.  And to be extra safe,
you do not need to be root to build or run Buildroot.
