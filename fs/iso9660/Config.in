	  Build a bootable ISO9660 image. By default, the root
	  filesystem is directly packed as the ISO9660 filesystem,
	  which means the root filesystem will be read-only. It
	  requires ISO9660 filesystem support and CDROM support in the
	  kernel.

	  However, if BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_INITRAMFS or
	  BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_ISO9660_INITRD have been enabled, the
	  ISO9660 filesystem will only contain a kernel image and
	  optionally an external initrd image. In this case, the
	  filesystem being in RAM, it will be read/write. No ISO9660
	  or CDROM support is needed in the kernel.

	  Use this option to provide a custom Grub menu.lst file. Note
	  that the strings __KERNEL_PATH__ and __INITRD_PATH__ will
	  automatically be replaced by the path to the kernel and
	  initrd images respectively.

	  Enable this option to have the root filesystem bundled as an
	  initrd/initramfs rather than directly as the ISO9660
	  filesystem. With this option enabled, the ISO9660 will only
	  contain a kernel image, an initrd image (unless an initramfs
	  linked into the kernel is used) and the bootloader.
