	  By default, dropbear uses the much more secure /dev/random.  If you
	  are using a system lacking usable entropy sources, this could cause
	  the dropbear ssh daemon to block forever waiting for entropy that
	  will never arrive.  By making dropbear use /dev/urandom, you can
	  prevent Dropbear from blocking while waiting on the random device.
	  This could however significantly reduce the security of your ssh
	  connections.  Make sure you know what you are doing if you enable
	  this option -- most people should answer N.
