	  JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM specification version 2 (blue book). 
	  In comparison to most other VM's (free and commercial) it is extremely small, with a stripped executable on PowerPC of only ~180K, and Intel 150K. 
	  However, unlike other small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and includes support for 
	  object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References, class-unloading, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.
