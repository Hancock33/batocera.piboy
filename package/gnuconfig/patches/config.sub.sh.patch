gnuconfig seems intent on only supporting superfluous targets that don't
represent any real hardware (such as sh2a LE). GCC in its infinite wisdom is
also incapable of supporting tuning for other variants in a sensible fashion.

As such, we still need to be able to support such useful targets as
sh2a_nofpueb in order to not only get the byte order right, but also to
support -m2a-nofpu tuning from the kernel (though we tend to do this through
-Wa,-isa= instead, as the binutils people do a much better job of not screwing
up their config code every other day. Way to go config.gcc..).

The fact that the sh variant matching is the ugliest out of any of the other
architectures doesn't seem to deter GCC folk from their well thought out and
brilliantly managed config target list.
