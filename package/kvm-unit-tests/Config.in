	  kvm-unit-tests is a project as old as KVM. As its name
	  suggests, it's purpose is to provide unit tests for KVM. The
	  unit tests are tiny guest operating systems that generally
	  execute only tens of lines of C and assembler test code in
	  order to obtain its PASS/FAIL result. Unit tests provide KVM
	  and virt hardware functional testing by targeting the
	  features through minimal implementations of their use per
	  the hardware specification. The simplicity of unit tests
	  make them easy to verify they are correct, easy to maintain,
	  and easy to use in timing measurements. Unit tests are also
	  often used for quick and dirty bug reproducers. The
	  reproducers may then be kept as regression tests.  It's
	  strongly encouraged that patches implementing new KVM
	  features are submitted with accompanying unit tests.
