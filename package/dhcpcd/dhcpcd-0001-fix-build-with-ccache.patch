configure: support builds using ccache

The configure script checks whether CC is executable by means of a check
'type $CC'. However, when using ccache, CC is normally set to "ccache gcc"
(using the appropriate paths). Such a compound string is not recognized by
type, however, and thus configure bails out.

This patch changes the check 'type $CC' with a compile test.

Upstream status: another implementation was submitted, modified by
maintainer Roy, then simplified based on my suggestion. This patch is a fold
of the two upstream patches:
