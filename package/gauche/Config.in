	  Gauche is an R7RS Scheme implementation developed to be a
	  handy script interpreter, which allows programmers and
	  system administrators to write small to large scripts for
	  their daily chores. Quick startup, built-in system
	  interface, native multilingual support are some of its
	  goals.
