		Kismet - 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system

		Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring (rfmon) mode, and can
		sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g traffic.
		
		Kismet identifies networks by passively collecting packets and detecting standard named
		networks, detecting (and given time, decloaking) hidden networks, and infering the presence
		of nonbeaconing networks via data traffic.
