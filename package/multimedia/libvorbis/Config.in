	  Library for the Vorbis open source audio decoder
	  Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
	  general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality
	  (8kHz-48.0kHz, 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and
	  variable bitrates from 16 to 128 kbps/channel.

	  This places Vorbis in the same competitive class as audio
	  representations such as MPEG-4 (AAC), and similar to, but higher
	  performance than MPEG-1/2 audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio (TwinVQ),
	  WMA and PAC.
