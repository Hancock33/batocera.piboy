gettext-runtime: use @SHELL@ for the SHELL variable definition

The gettext-runtime/Makefile.in uses an hardcoded SHELL = /bin/sh
variable. This causes problems at build time, because libtool is then
called with the 'sh' shell, which does not support the += construct
that the libtool script is using.

Instead, this Makefile.in should be definining SHELL = @SHELL@, just
like all other Makefile.in of gettext.
