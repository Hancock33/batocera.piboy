	  The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available
          read/write NTFS driver for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, NetBSD,
          and Haiku. It provides safe and fast handling of the Windows
          XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and Windows Vista file
          systems. Most POSIX file system operations are supported, with
          the exception of full file ownership and access right support.
