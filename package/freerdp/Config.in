	  FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop
	  Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license

	  This only installs the freerdp library.

	  http://www.freerdp.com/

	  Note: this also installs a key and certificate in
	  /etc/freerdp/keys/ . These are publicly-known, as they
	  are present in FreeRDP's source tree. It is strongly
	  suggested that you overwrite them with your own set,
	  either in an overlay rootfs or in a post-build script.
