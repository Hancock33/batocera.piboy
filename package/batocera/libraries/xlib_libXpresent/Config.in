	  X11 Present extension library
	  libXpresent provides an X Window System client interface to the
	  Present extension to the X protocol. The Present extension
	  provides a way for applications to update their window contents
	  from a pixmap in a well defined fashion, synchronizing with the
	  display refresh and potentially using a more efficient mechanism
	  than copying the contents of the source pixmap.
