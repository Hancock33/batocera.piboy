    <desc>In Prototype all the great gadgets and gizmos are present you would expect from a shooter. The all-protecting force shield defends your ship both fore and after. A horde of metallic killing machines will attempt to send you to an early death. Staying alive takes a vigilant eye and a steady stream of killer beams. The graphics are executed with a great deal of imagination and flair.</desc>
