    <desc>Hydra Castle Labyrinth is an old school action / platform game. 
The game starts with your character inside the castle, without any introduction or tutorial. You just start playing and decide which direction to go. 
At first, your character doesn't have a special item, just his sword. As you progress, you find new items that will help you in your quest, as some levels are particularly difficult. 
Besides the normal enemies that you encounter throughout the game, you will also find bosses here and there, and like back then they will be tough. 
Hydra Castle Labyrinth is quite a fun platform game, featuring gameplay that despite the years still performs very well.</desc>
