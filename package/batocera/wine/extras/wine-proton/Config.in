	  Proton is a Wine build modified by Valve and other 
	  contributors.	  It contains many useful patches 
	  (primarily for a better gaming experience),some of
	  them are unique and not present in other builds.
	  The differences from the official Steam's Proton are
	  the lack of the Proton's python script and the lack of
	  some builtin dlls (like DXVK and vkd3d-proton).
