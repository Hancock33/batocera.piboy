      Proton is a Wine build modified by Valve and other contributors.
      It contains many useful patches (primarily for a better gaming experience),
      some of them are unique and not present in other builds.
      The differences from the official Steam's Proton are the lack of the Proton's python script
      and the lack of some builtin dlls (like DXVK and vkd3d-proton).
