=== Note ===
WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs.
It should work on any version from Windows XP onwards.

You use this software at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage it may do to your filesystem. It ought to be suitable for day-to-day use, but make sure you take backups anyway.

Everything here is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL); see the file LICENCE for more info. You are encouraged to play about with the source code as you will, and I'd appreciate a note (mark@harmstone.com) if you come up with anything nifty.

=== Installation ===
To install the driver, right-click btrfs.inf, and choose Install.
The driver is signed, so should work out of the box on modern versions of Windows.

For the very latest versions of Windows 10, Microsoft introduced more onerous requirements for signing,
which are only available to corporations and not individuals.
If this affects you (i.e. you get a signing error when trying to install the driver),
try disabling Secure Boot in your BIOS settings.
