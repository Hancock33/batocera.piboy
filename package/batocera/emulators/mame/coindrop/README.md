Coin Drop Sounds:

Provides a coin drop sound effect when a coin is inserted in MAME. Gives a little extra info if -verbose is on.

Currently selects one of three random sounds. Eventually, it will have some variations to use based on coin count, to sound like a fuller coin box.

Tested in Windows & Batocera Linux.
