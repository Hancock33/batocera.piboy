		<name>Blood Warrior</name>
		<desc>The gameplay of Blood Warrior is quite similar to many of the 2D fighting games of the same era. However, Kaneko seem to have taken much of their inspiration from the Mortal Kombat franchise in terms of over the top gore and violence; however, Blood Warrior's predecessor Shogun Warriors predates Mortal Kombat in featuring blood, while Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior predates Mortal Kombat in featuring death moves.</desc>

		<name>Boggy '84</name>
		<desc>Boggy '84 is one of those games of which countless numbers were made in the early eighties during the homecomputer boom. It is slightly similar to Mappy or Space Panic but without the refinements of said games.

You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.</desc>

		<name>Shogun Warriors (World)</name>
		<desc>Shogun Warriors plays similarly to some other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. It is controlled with an 8-way joystick and 4 buttons that perform weak and strong versions of punches and kicks. In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood to spurt out, which became popularized a few months later by Midway's Mortal Kombat. The main unique feature of Shogun Warriors is its "grabbing system". When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to make it more difficult for his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape.</desc>

		<desc>VS Gong Fight es un juego de boxeo arcade, que fue lanzado por Kaneko en 1984 y licenciado a Taito Corporation para su fabricación y distribución en los Estados Unidos, bajo el nombre de Ring Fighter. Los jugadores deben usar un joystick de 4 vías para tomar el control de un boxeador (1P's usa guantes azules, baúles y botas, pero 2P's usa guantes rojos), con dos botones para hacerlos golpear y bloquear - y si sólo un jugador está jugando el juego, 2P's boxer será controlado por la CPU y silueteado en negro. Los niveles de energía de ambos boxeadores se muestran en las esquinas superior izquierda y superior derecha de la pantalla, con sus niveles de "daño" en las esquinas inferior izquierda y inferior derecha de la pantalla; el número de la ronda actual y su tiempo restante también se muestran en el centro superior de la pantalla. Al igual que en el boxeo real, tienes que golpear a tu oponente antes de que se acabe el tiempo, para proceder a la siguiente ronda - y una vez que lo hayas hecho, tendrás que enfrentarte a otro oponente de la CPU, o se acabará el juego para el perdedor.</desc>

		<name>Air Buster - Trouble Specialty Raid Unit (World)</name>
		<desc>Air Buster is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up video game produced by Kaneko and co-distributed by Namco for the arcades in 1990. It was subsequently ported to the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (under the title Aero Blasters) and for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991.
In Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. Players choose between one of the two Blaster fighters through scrolling six stages. The Blaster fighters can equip one of seven weapons. The weapons include the Striker weapon which adds additional firepower through vertically aligned Options, the Reverse shot which fires two diagonal shots from the rear of the ship, the Six Way Shot which fires semi-automatic shots in six directions and the Homing Shot which tracks enemies all around the screen. The other three weapons are Missile based which vary from Red straight-firing Rockets and Green Homing Missiles. There is also the Border item which surrounds the front of the ship, keeping it from crashing into foreground objects. The only other Items include Power-Ups which increase the ship's standard shot power and Bonus Points that appear in the sign of Dollar signs.</desc>

		<desc>The player is set in control of The Garland TFF-01, a sub-standard space fighter ship that is only armed with a semi-auto or rapid fire laser gun known as the Beam Vulcan and the Tranquilander. Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player's Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks.

There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected.</desc>
