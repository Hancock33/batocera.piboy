## SEGA MODEL 2 IMPORTANT INFO ##
---------------------------------

You need to run a ROM at least once AND be connected to the internet.
This creates the directory structure & installs the associated Windows DirectX libraries for Wine.

Note: It may take some time before the game starts with the first use, this is NORMAL!
*** Please be patient as it can take up to 10 minutes depending on your internet connection speed ***

------------------------
Controller configuration
------------------------

Note: A keyboard & mouse is required in addition to your controller(s).

A set on input files is provided however you may want to map your controls per game ROM you intend to run.
We recommend you do this using the Emulation Station 'F1' menu option and then choose the model2 config app.
*** The ROM must be loaded before you can configure the controls. ***

Press Esc on your keyboard to go back to 'windowed' mode to then set the controller options if the app goes fullscreen.
Once the controls are set, they're saved for future use in Batocera through the normal menu options.

------------
Service Menu
------------

Note: Keyboard required.

Appropriate NVDATA files have been provided to ensure all games should work straight away.
If you receive the error 'Network Board Not Present' when starting a game.
Go to the Service Menu using F2 and then use F1 to navigate to 'Games System' & press F2.
Under 'Games System', choose 'Link ID' using F1 & then use F2 to change this option to 'Single'.
Use F1 to navigate to 'Exit', hit F2 again.
Do this one more time to exit the Service Menu.

The Service Menu configuration will be saved and the error will not occur again in future usage.

-----------------
Batocera Upgrades
-----------------

In some instances when you upgrade Batocera to a new version, when trying to run the Sega Model 2 emulator it may crash.
When you look at your /userdata/system/logs/es_launch_stderr.log file you may see a Wine mismatch error.
This is due to the wine bottle being out of date and not aligning to the version installed with the latest Batocera.
If you do, you should backup your /userdata/saves/model2/model2emu/CFG & userdata/saves/model2/model2emu/NVDATA folders.
When browsing using the network share you won't see the userdata directory, browse to saves.
Backing these folders up will retain your high scores, rom & controller configurations.

It's recommended to remove your /userdata/saves/model2/ directory via ssh only!
When logged in via ssh:
cd /userdata/saves
rm -rf model2

Once done, re-launch a game when connected to the internet & it will re-create the wine bottle for you.
Afterwards you can restore your CFG & NVDATA directories.

*** Enjoy the Sega Model 2 emulator running under Linux !!! ***
