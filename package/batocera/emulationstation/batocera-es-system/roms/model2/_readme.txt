## SEGA MODEL 2 IMPORTANT INFO ##
---------------------------------

You need to run a ROM at least once AND be connected to the internet.
This creates the directory structure & installs the associated Windows DirectX libraries for Wine.

Note: It may take some time before the game starts with the first use, this is NORMAL!
*** Please be patient as it can take up to 10 minutes depending on your internet connection speed ***

------------------------
Controller configuration
------------------------

Note: A keyboard & mouse is required in addition to your controller(s).

You must map your controls per game ROM you intend to run.
We recommend you do this using the Emulation Station 'F1' menu option and then choose the model2 config app.
*** The ROM must be loaded before you can configure the controls. ***

Press Esc on your keyboard to go back to 'windowed' mode to then set the controller options if the app goes fullscreen.
Once the controls are set, they're saved for future use in Batocera through the normal menu options.

------------
Service Menu
------------

Note: Keyboard required.

If you receive the error 'Network Board Not Present' when starting a game.
Go to the Service Menu using F2 and then use F1 to navigate to 'Games System' & press F2.
Under 'Games System', choose 'Link ID' using F1 & then use F2 to change this option to 'Single'.
Use F1 to navigate to 'Exit', hit F2 again.
Do this one more time to exit the Service Menu.

The Service Menu configuration will be saved and the error will not occur again in future usage.

*** Enjoy the Sega Model 2 emulator running under Linux !!! ***
