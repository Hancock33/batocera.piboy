# The DOOM engines supports countless number of third-party WADs — called PWADs (or “Patch WADs”) — built by diligent members of the DOOM community over the past 28 or so years. 
# Every PWAD needs a specific IWAD in order to work. In this case below it is doom.wad and the PWAD is obviously the mod to be loaded loaded.
#
# Note 1. You cannot run mods with the shareware or demo versions
# Note 2. The filepath is case sensitive.
# Note 3. PK3 files are only compatable with GZDOOM
