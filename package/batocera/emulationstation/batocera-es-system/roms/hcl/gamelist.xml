The game hearkens back to early Metroidvania games like Knightmare II The Maze of Galious and Legacy of the Wizard the player explores an immense maze-like dungeon, collecting tools and keys that allow them to proceed deeper. Certain areas are cordoned off from the main dungeon area, and each presents a more linear zone with a boss at the end. The player can find new equipment to make themselves stronger as well.</desc>
