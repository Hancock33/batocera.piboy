    <desc>Fade to Black is the sequel to Flashback: the Quest for Identity. The player takes control of Conrad, the hero from Flashback who has been imprisoned by his old enemy, the Morphs. Gaining the trust and assistance of the mysterious Ancients, Conrad must fight off the Morph invasion, not knowing whom he can trust.The game uses fully polygonal graphics for both character models and environment. The camera changes angles depending on the location of the player character, similar to the Alone in the Dark series. Conrad can use various weapons to eliminate the enemies and will also have to solve some puzzles on the way. He can not, however, perform as many moves as in Flashback; he can't climb or jump, and the only way he can potentially avoid being shot by enemies is by ducking.
