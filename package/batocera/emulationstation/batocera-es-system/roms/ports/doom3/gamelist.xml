		<name>Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil</name>
		<desc>Resurrection of Evil adds in two new main features to the gameplay that the player can use throughout the game. The first, is a tool that was originally developed for Doom 3; the Grabber. The Grabber, like the "gravity gun" from the game Half-Life 2, is a physics-based weapon that allows the player to pick up and move certain items. It also allows the player to catch fireballs and throw them back at the enemy. Resurrection of Evil has come under some criticism about the use of the Grabber due to the prior popularity of the similar weapon in Half-Life 2. The developers have commented that the tool was originally in Doom 3 before Half-Life 2, and was used to create damaged rooms; instead of building a ruined room, they would build a pristine room and use the grabber to damage it realistically.</desc>
