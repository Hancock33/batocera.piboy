Play the multiplayer online game - Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.
You need the original game .pk3 data files from your copy purchased from GOG or Steam.
Alternatively, you can get the game files from :
https://www.splashdamage.com/games/wolfenstein-enemy-territory/

Copy the .pk3 files from the folder `etmain` from your installation into this rom folder ensuring they're added to their own `etmain` folder.
i.e. /userdata/roms/ports/etlegacy/etmain

Create a blank file `Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory.etl` which will launch the game & allow you to scrape the game data via EmulationStation.

Notes: For the best experience you need a mouse & keyboard.
       Game controllers can also be configured for your user.
       The set language only applies on initial boot. Any previous profiles will need to be changed manually.
       You may have to create a user profile twice for it to save.
       Batocera only provides the client with mods & NOT the server to host matches.
