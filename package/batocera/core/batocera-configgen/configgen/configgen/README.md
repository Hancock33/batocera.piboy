 - `generators` The infamous Python configuration generators, bane of the end-user who's used to modifying INI and XML files directly. These are what create the necessary configuration files, controller profiles and any other necessary INI/CFG file an emulator uses upon launching an emulator. Used in conjunction with [ES features](https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera.linux/blob/master/package/batocera/emulationstation/batocera-es-system/es_features.yml) to make these generated configs based on the options the user has set in ES. If creating a new one, don't forget to [define](https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera.linux/blob/master/package/batocera/core/batocera-configgen/configgen/configgen/emulatorlauncher.py) it as well.
 - `batoceraFiles.py` The paths used by emulators for their configuration files, saves, etc.
 - `Emulator.py` How do we grab all the settings? And in what order?
 - `emulatorlauncher.py` The main launcher.
