	  The Spice project aims to provide a complete open source
	  solution for interaction with virtualized desktop devices.
	  The Spice project deals with both the virtualized devices
	  and the front-end. Interaction between front-end and
	  back-end is done using VD-Interfaces.
	  
	  This package implements the server-part of Spice.
