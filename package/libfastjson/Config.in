	  Libfastjson - A fast json library for C

	  Libfastjson is a fork from json-c. The aim of this project
	  is not to provide a slightly modified clone of json-c.
	  Its aim is to provide:

	  - a small library with essential json handling functions
	  - sufficiently good json support (not 100% standards compliant)
	  - be very fast in processing
