# joycond is a service that pairs Nintendo Switch joy-cons together into a virtual controller

#########
# USAGE #
#########

# Joycons #
# ======= #

# With the joy-cons, to use a single controller alone:
# Once paired via bluetooth you will have the four indicator lights flashing.
# Hold ZL and L at the same time (ZR and R for the right joy-con).
# Alternatively, hold both S triggers at once (when held horizontally).

# To combine two joy-cons into a virtual input device:
# Ensure both joycons are on & all four indicator lights are flashing on both joycons.
# Press a *single* trigger (L2 & R2 or ZL & ZR) on both of them at the same time.
# A new input device will be created called "Nintendo Switch Combined Joy-Cons".

# Note: When using a virtual combined controller, Batocera will see three controllers (Left, Right & Virtual)
#       You may need to manually assign the controller number in EmulationStation for emulator compatibility.
