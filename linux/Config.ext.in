	  Xenomai is split in two parts: a kernel part and a userspace
	  part. Enabling this option automatically selects the Xenomai
	  package and helps in patching the Linux kernel built by
	  Buildroot with the Xenomai kernel part (ie Adeos/Ipipe).

	  You can find the currently supported kernel versions by
	  looking at the available patches in the Xenomai sources
	  tree: ksrc/arch/$(ARCH)/patches

	  However, it is recommended to use the latest version of the
	  Adeos/Ipipe patch available at
	  http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches

	  Xenomai is know to support Blackfin, SH4, x86, ARM, NIOS2
	  and PowerPC architectures.

config BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_EXT_XENOMAI_ADEOS_PATCH
	string "Path for Adeos patch file"
	depends on BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_EXT_XENOMAI
	help
	  Optionally, explicitly specify the Adeos patch to use.
	  Download it at http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches
	  and verify that your kernel version in buildroot matches.

# fbtft
config BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_EXT_FBTFT
	bool "FB TFT drivers"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_FBTFT
	help
	  Linux Framebuffer drivers for small TFT LCD display modules,
	  e.g. Adafruit PiTFT displays for Raspberry Pi (this extra
	  package is only needed for linux kernels until v3.19, since
	  v4.0 the drivers are included in the staging area).

	  To enable fbtft, e.g. for Adafruit 2.8 PiTFT, enable the
	  following kernel configurations:
	  - CONFIG_SPI
	  - CONFIG_GPIOLIB
	  - CONFIG_FB
	  - CONFIG_FB_TFT
	  - CONFIG_FB_TFT_ILI9341
