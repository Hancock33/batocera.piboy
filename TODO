Buildroot2 TODOs

- fix packages/Makefile.autotools.in to use a package-imposed patchdir
  (Ivan Kuten)
- convert all packages that use autoconf to use the infrastructure of
  packages/Makefile.autotools.in
- fix setting of flags for packages

- coreutils: use make install-strip to install the packages. For now,
  it fails beause even if we pass STRIP="/path/to/$(ARCH)-strip", the
  coreutils build system uses the host strip to strip target
  binaries. The ./configure execution done by Buildroot properly
  detects the cross-strip, but when running make, build-aux/missing
  gets run, complains about aclocal-1.10c and atuomake-1.10c not being
  present, and rerun the configuration... with the wrong environment
  variables (STRIP= is missing). An autoreconf on this package is
  probably necessary.
